Choose a `Label` and click `Shape` or `Track` to start drawing. An ellipse can be created the same way as
a [rectangle](/docs/manual/advanced/annotation-with-rectangles/), you need to specify two opposite points,
and the ellipse will be inscribed in a rectangle. Press `N` or click the `Done` button on the top panel
to complete the shape.

You can rotate the created ellipse using a rotation point in the same way as
a [rectangle](/docs/manual/advanced/annotation-with-rectangles/#rotation-rectangle).
