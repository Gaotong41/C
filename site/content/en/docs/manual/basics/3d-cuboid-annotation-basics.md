To move in 3D space you can use several methods:
- Move using the mouse:
  - Hold down the left mouse button in the perspective window to turn the camera around the conditional point.
  - Hold down the right mouse button in the perspective window to move the camera inside the 3D space.
  - Move the mouse while holding down the wheel to zoom in/out in the perspective window.
  - Scroll the wheel to zoom in/out (works both in perspective and in projections).

  - To move up/down use: `Alt-U`/`Alt+O`.

## Creating a cuboid

To create a cube in a 3D task you need to click the appropriate icon on the control sidebar, select the label of the future object and click "shape".

After that the cursor will be followed by a cube. In the creation process you can rotate and move the camera.
Left double-click will create an object.
You can place an object only near the dots of the point cloud.

To adjust the size precisely, you need to edit the cuboid on the projections.
In each projection you can:

Move the object in the projection plane - to do this, hover over the object, press the left mouse button and move the object

Move one of the four points - you can change the size of the cuboid by dragging the points in the projection

Rotate the cuboid in the projection plane â€“ to rotate the cuboid you should click on the appropriate point
and then drag it up/down or to the left/right.
