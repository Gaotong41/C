`Perspective` – a main window for work with objects in a 3D task.

Projections - projections are tied to an object so that a cuboid is in the center and looks like a rectangle. Projections show only the selected object.

- `Top` – a projection of the view from above.
- `Side` – a projection of the left side of the object.
- `Front` - a frontal projection of the object.
