In CVAT you can use [AWS-S3](using-aws-s3), [Azure Blob Container](#using-azure-blob-container)
and [Google cloud](#using-google-cloud-storage) storages to store image datasets for your tasks.

## Google Cloud

### Create a bucket

1. Create [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) and log into it.
2. On  the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) page, click **Start Free**, then enter the required
   data and accept the terms of service.
   > **Note:**  Google requires to add payment, you will need bank card to accomplish step 2.
3. [Create a Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) with the following parameters:
   - **Name your bucket**: Unique name.
   - **Choose where to store your data**: Set up a location nearest to you.
   - **Choose a storage class for your data**: `Set a default class` > `Standart`.
   - **Choose how to control access to objects**: `Enforce public access prevention on this bucket` >
     `Uniform` (default).
   - **How to protect data**: `None`

You will be forwarded to the bucket.

### Upload data

You need to upload data for annotation and `manifest.json` file.

1. Prepare data.
   For more information,
   see [prepare dataset.](#prepare-dataset).
2. Open the bucket and from the top menu
   select **Upload files** or **Upload folder**
   (based on how your files are organized)

  - [**Azure Blob Container**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/):

    - `Container name` - name of the cloud storage container.

      - `Authorization type`:

        - [`Account name and SAS token`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/document-translation/create-sas-tokens?tabs=blobs):

          - `Account name` - storage account name.
          - `SAS token` - is located in the `Shared access signature` section of your `Storage account` [learn more](#sas-token).

        - [`Anonymous access`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure?tabs=portal) -
          for anonymous access `enable blob public access` in the `configuration` section of your storage account.
          in this case, you only need the storage account name to gain anonymous access.
          - `Account name` - storage account name.

    </br>



- `Manifest` - the path to the manifest file on your cloud storage.
  You can add multiple manifest files using the `Add manifest` button.
  You can find on how to prepare dataset manifest [`here`](/docs/manual/advanced/dataset_manifest/).
  If you have data on the cloud storage and don't want to download content locally, you can mount your
  cloud storage as a share point according to [`that guide`](/docs/administration/advanced/mounting_cloud_storages/)
  and prepare manifest for the data.

To publish the cloud storage, click `submit`, after which it will be available on
the [Cloud storages page](/docs/manual/basics/cloud-storages/).

On how to grant public access to the
bucket, see
[Configuring block public access settings for your S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configuring-block-public-access-bucket.html)

### Attach AWS S3 storage

To attach storage, do the following:

1. Log into CVAT and in the separate tab
   open you bucket page.
2. In the CVAT, on the top menu select **Cloud storages** > on the opened page click **+**.


Fill in the following fields:
|CVAT| AWS S3|
|----|----|
|**Display name**|Create a display name|
|**Description**|(Optional) Add descripton of storage|
|**Provider**|From drop-down list select **AWS S3**.|
|**Bucket name**|Name of the [Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket).|
|**Authorization type**|Depends on the bucket setup: <br><li>**Key id and secret access key pair**: available on [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/users). <br><li>**Anonymous access**: for anonymous access. Public access to the bucket must be enabled.|
|**Region**| (Optional) Choose a region from the list or add a new one. For more information, see [**Available locations**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions).|
|**Manifests**|Click **+ Add manifest** and enter the name of the manifest file with extention. For example: `manifest.json`|



## Using AWS Data Exchange

### Subscribe to data set

You can use AWS Data Exchange to add image datasets.
For example, consider adding a set of datasets `500 Image & Metadata Free Sample`.
Go to [browse catalog](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange) and use the search to find
`500 Image & Metadata Free Sample`, open the dataset page and click `continue to subscribe`,
you will be taken to the page complete subscription request, read the information provided
and click send subscription request to provider.

![](/images/aws-s3_tutorial_6.jpg)

### Export to bucket

After that, this dataset will appear in the
[list subscriptions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home/subscriptions#/subscriptions).
Now you need to export the dataset to `Amazon S3`.
First, let's create a new one bucket similar to [described above](#create-a-bucket).
To export one of the datasets to a new bucket open it `entitled data` select one of the datasets,
select the corresponding revision and click export to Amazon S3
(please note that if bucket and dataset are located in different regions, export fees may apply).
In the window that appears, select the created bucket and click export.

![](/images/aws-s3_tutorial_7.jpg)

### Prepare manifest file

Now you need to prepare a manifest file. I used [AWS cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and
[script for prepare manifest file](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/tree/develop/utils/dataset_manifest).
Perform the installation using the manual [aws-shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell),
I used `aws-cli 1.20.49` `Python 3.7.9` `Windows 10`.
You can configure credentials by running `aws configure`.
You will need to enter `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` as well as region.

```bash
aws configure
Access Key ID: <your Access Key ID>
Secret Access Key: <your Secret Access Key>
```

Copy the content of the bucket to a folder on your computer:

```bash
aws s3 cp <s3://bucket-name> <yourfolder> --recursive
```

After copying the files, you can create a manifest file as described in [preapair manifest file section](/docs/manual/advanced/dataset_manifest/):

```bash
python <cvat repository>/utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir <yourfolder> <yourfolder>
```

When the manifest file is ready, you can upload it to aws s3 bucket. If you gave full write permissions
when you created the user, run:

```bash
aws s3 cp <yourfolder>/manifest.jsonl <s3://bucket-name>
```

If you have given read-only permissions, use the download through the browser, click upload,
drag the manifest file to the page and click upload.

![](/images/aws-s3_tutorial_5.jpg)

Now you can [attach new cloud storage](#attach-new-cloud-storage) using the dataset `500 Image & Metadata Free Sample`.

#### Prepare dataset

For example, let's take [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/):

- Download the [archive with images](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/images.tar.gz).
- Unpack the archive into the prepared folder
  and create a manifest file as described in [prepare manifest file section](/docs/manual/advanced/dataset_manifest/):

  ```bash
  python <cvat repository>/utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir <yourfolder> <yourfolder>
  ```
