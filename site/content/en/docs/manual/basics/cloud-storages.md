The cloud storages page contains elements, each of them relating to a separate cloud storage. 
Each element contains: preview, cloud storage name, provider, creation and update info, status,
`?` button for displaying the description and the actions menu.

Each button in the action menu is responsible for a specific function:
- `Update` — update this cloud storage
- `Delete` — delete cloud storage.

This preview will appear when it is impossible to get a real preview (e.g. storage is empty or
invalid credentials were used).

In the upper left corner there is a search bar,
using which you can find the cloud storage by designated display name, provider, etc.
In the upper right corner there are
[sorting and filtering tools](/docs/manual/advanced/filter/#sort-and-filter-projects-tasks-and-jobs).

Click the `+` button to [attach a new cloud storage](/docs/manual/basics/attach-cloud-storage/).
