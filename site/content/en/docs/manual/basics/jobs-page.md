On the jobs page, users (for example, with the worker role)
can see the jobs that are assigned to them without having access to the task page,
as well as track progress, sort and apply filters to the job list.

On the job page there is a list of jobs presented in the form of tiles, where each tile is one job.
Each element contains:
- job ID
- dimension `2D` or `3D`
- preview
- stage and state [see vocabulary section](/docs/manual/basics/vocabulary)
- when hovering over an element, you can see:
    - size
    - assignee
- menu to navigate to a task, project, or bug tracker.

> To open the job in a new tab, click on the job by holding `Ctrl`.

In the upper left corner there is a search bar, using which you can find the job by designated user, stage, state, etc.
In the upper right corner there are
[sorting and filtering tools](/docs/manual/advanced/filter/#sort-and-filter-projects-tasks-and-jobs).
