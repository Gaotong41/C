This is the main field in which drawing and editing objects takes place.
In addition the workspace also has the following functions:

## Object card

- Right-clicking on an object calls up the `Object card` - this is an element containing
  the necessary controls for changing the label and attributes of the object, as well as the action menu.

## Z-axis slider

`Z-axis slider` - Allows you to switch annotation layers hiding the upper layers
(slider is enabled if several z layers are on a frame).
This element has a button for adding a new layer. When pressed, a new layer is added and switched to it.
